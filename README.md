# All For One - Build

## 2/13/2026

## Description:
    This project uses an API I created for the mini challenges to add functionality towards my website 
    for the user to interact! It is fully functional with js front-end and an API endpoint back-end!

## Notes
    Link to azure build: https://white-island-0ac32031e.1.azurestaticapps.net/index.html

## Peer Review () : Vanessa Acuna - I loved the way you use cards. All games worked for me and so did the Azure link. Great Job!
