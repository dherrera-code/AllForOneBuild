# All For One - Build

## 2/13/2026

## Description:
    This project uses an API I created for the mini challenges to add functionality towards my website 
    for the user to interact! It is fully functional with js front-end and an API endpoint back-end!

## Notes
    Need to adjust all the font in the first home page! 

    Update footer btns for better responsiveness for tablet (middle)
